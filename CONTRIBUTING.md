Since this is a young project a lot of these guidelines may change.

### Guidelines
* Use [jsdoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) conventions to document the code
* Put stylesheets in the **styles** folder
* Put images in the **images** folder
* Put templates in the **templates** folder
* Put code in the **lib** folder
* Put tests in the **tests** folder
* When creating windows add the prefix **window-** in the files
* Match the structure of lib on the tests folder
* If you are considering tackling an open issue, comment before if you can so that no work goes to waste
